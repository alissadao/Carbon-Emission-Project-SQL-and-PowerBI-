# Carbon Emission Project SQL and PowerBI
***In this project, I will analyze and visualize my dataset using SQL and PowerBi.***
***I will use this dataset to discover some aspects: America's highest and lowest amount of carbon emission by Year, the country with the most significant and most downward emissions per capital in 2017 compared to the changes of emissions per capital in 1975,...***

## 1. About the project: 
###### a. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with SQL: 
- SELECT, SELECT TOP, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- AGGREGATION FUNCTION: MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), ROUND()
- CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, WITH AS, INNER JOIN

###### b. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with PowerBI: 
- Area chart, Donut chart, Multi-row card, Clustered column chart
- Dynamic text utilizing Smart Narrative, Slicer

## 2. About the dataset: 
- There are two databaes in my project: 

###### a. Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv)
- Overall: The database contains the amount of carbon emissions per capital in a country as well as total carbon emission in countries over the world. 
- Tool: SQL to clean and analyze, PowerBI to visualize

###### b. Reduced Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [UN - environment program](https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/)
- Overall: This database contains information about how much carbon emissions can be reduced in six different sector. 
- Tool: PowerBI to visualize

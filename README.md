# Carbon Emission Project SQL and PowerBI
***In this project, I will analyze and visualize my database using SQL and PowerBi.***

## 1. About the project: 
###### a. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with SQL: 
- SELECT, SELECT TOP, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- AGGREGATION FUNCTION: MIN(), MAX(), SUM(), ROUND()
- CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, WITH AS, INNER JOIN

###### b. Some highlighted features that I will use when I work with PowerBI: 
- Area chart, Donut chart, Multi-row card, Clustered column chart
- Dynamic text utilizing Smart Narrative, Slicer

## 2. About the dataset: 
- There are two databaes in my project: 

###### a. Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv)
- Overall: The database contains the amount of carbon emissions per capital in a country as well as total carbon emission in countries over the world. 
- Tool: SQL to clean and analyze, PowerBI to visualize

###### b. Reduced Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [UN - environment program](https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/)
- Overall: This database contains information about how much carbon emissions can be reduced in six different sector. 
- Tool: PowerBI to visualize
